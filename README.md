# R2D2-Multiple_Goals_Maze_Search
This project combine the A star and Traveling Salesman Algorithm to generate the shortest path between multiple goals and visualized it on R2D2 platform.

#Function Description#

graph.py -- input the vertices and edges to generate a map

multiple_Astar.py -- common A star algorithm to calculate the shortest path between two points

tsp.py -- input the start and goals to reach, using traveling salesman algorthm to compute the best order

r2d2_action.py r2d2_move.py -- convert the path to commands of actual robots
